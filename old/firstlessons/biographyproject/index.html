    <p> I was born in Moscow. I studied Law at the Univesity.
        Started my career in the year 2006 at financial sector
        as a corporate lawyer.
        In 2016 I moved to Berlin with my family.
        Decided to stay more with my family
        and to spend more time with my little daugther Eva.
        who was born in Belin in the year 2018.
        In 2018 
        I started to learn UX/UI Design at Redi. After that course
        I realized that I can switch career into IT. I liked 
        this movement which takes place in this sector.
        After 3,5 years of parenthood I decided to return
        to my career. 
        Now I am tryimg to switch into IT with HTML/CSS course.
